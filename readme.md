# The Otus Programming Language
The Otus programming language aims to be a *"simple but powerful"* alternative to C, and takes heavy inspiration from languages such as [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) and 
[Jai](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmV5I2fxaiCKfxMBrNsU1kgKJXD3PkyxO). The current goal of the language is to be:
* **Clear and concise**, to remove unnecessary complexity
* **Powerful**, to ease the development of large and complex software
* **Lightweight**, to allow greater expressiveness without a loss of performance
